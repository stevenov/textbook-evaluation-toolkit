Create a title for your post and answer these questions in 250 words or less:

1. Reflecting back on our work this semester, in what ways are textbooks a challenge for students? It might be helpful to review [The Textbook Manifesto](https://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/) and your initial discussion board post about it.
2. What is one way OER addresses these challenges? What is one way OER fails to address them?
3. Should students evaluate textbooks as part of their regular classwork/education? Why or why not?
4. Imagine you are a professor choosing a textbook for your class. What are three important ideas to consider when selecting a textbook for students?
5. What is the most important thing you learned from this seminar?

*This final reflection is based upon this week one prompt*:

	Read "[Textbook manifesto](https://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/)" by Allen B. Downey. Briefly write about a textbook challenge (or challenges) you wish to solve. Add to the Manifesto in discussion board by adding a call-to-action for professors, students, AND publishers (one Manifesto item for each group).
